Stage 1: Prerequisites
✅ Must Know Before Spring Boot:
Core Java (8+)

OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation)

Collections (List, Map, Set)

Exception handling

Streams and Lambdas

Build Tools

Maven or Gradle (start with Maven)

IDE

IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

Basic Web Knowledge

HTTP, REST, JSON

Basic HTML/CSS for testing frontends (Postman also fine)

🚀 Stage 2: Spring Core (Before Boot)
Understand how traditional Spring works before jumping into Spring Boot magic.

Dependency Injection (DI) / IoC

Spring Beans & Lifecycle

Configuration: XML vs Java-based

Spring Annotations (@Component, @Autowired, etc.)

Spring AOP (optional at this stage)

🔧 Project Idea: Create a simple console-based app using Spring Core with DI.

🔥 Stage 3: Getting Started with Spring Boot
What is Spring Boot and why it’s better than classic Spring

Project Structure of a Spring Boot application

Using Spring Initializr to bootstrap projects

@SpringBootApplication, application.properties

📦 Practice:

Create a simple REST API (e.g., Todo list or Book app)

Use @RestController, @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, etc.

💾 Stage 4: Data Handling with Spring Boot
Spring Data JPA

What is JPA / Hibernate

Entity, Repository, CrudRepository / JpaRepository

JPQL vs Native Queries

Connecting to Databases

H2 (in-memory) for practice

MySQL or PostgreSQL for real apps

📦 Practice:

Create a CRUD REST API using JPA + H2/MySQL

🛡️ Stage 5: Validation, Exception Handling, Logging
Bean Validation (@Valid, @NotNull, etc.)

Global Exception Handling (@ControllerAdvice)

Logging with SLF4J/Logback

🧪 Stage 6: Testing
Unit Testing with JUnit 5

Spring Boot Test (@WebMvcTest, @DataJpaTest)

MockMvc for REST endpoint testing

📦 Stage 7: Advanced Concepts
Spring Security (JWT, OAuth2)

Spring Boot with Thymeleaf (if you want server-side rendering)

Spring Boot with REST clients (RestTemplate, WebClient)

Profiles (application-dev.properties, etc.)

Actuator (monitoring and metrics)

Caching (@Cacheable)

☁️ Stage 8: DevOps & Deployment
Dockerize a Spring Boot App

Build a JAR and run via java -jar

Deploy to:

Heroku (easy)

AWS (EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk)

Kubernetes (advanced)

🧠 Bonus: Learn via Projects
Here are a few ideas:

Student Management System

Task Manager REST API

Expense Tracker with JWT auth

Blog platform with Spring Security + JPA

E-commerce backend with product & cart APIs

🔁 Consistency Tip:
Practice daily with small projects.
